# Companion code for my bachelor's thesis

This repository contains all of the code that appears in my bachelor's thesis titled "Stochastic Processes and Methods in Computational Physics". Additionally it contains code for visualizing the algorithms' results. The two jupyter notbooks contained herein correspond to the second and third chapter of my textbook.  
In order to view, use and run the code you can download the notebooks and open them using the jupyter notebook program **or** you can click on the binder badge below for online viewing **or** you can view but not interact with the notebooks in [this static notebook viewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/spirosbax/textbook-companion/tree/master/).

Installation instructions for the Jupyter environment can be found [here](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#installing-jupyter-notebook).  
Installation instructions for the Julia language can be found [here](https://julialang.org/downloads/).  
I recomment installing the complete JuliaPro IDE which can be found [here](https://juliacomputing.com/products/juliapro.html). JuliaPro is a complete interactive environment that you can use and it comes with instructions! The best solution for newcomers. Bear in mind that you will have to copy and paste code intro juliapro from the notebooks in this repository, since JuliaPro cannot open jupyter notebooks.
